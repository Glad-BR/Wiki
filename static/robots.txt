# (b)  If a Content-Signal = no, you may not collect content for the

# The content signals and their meanings are:

# search:   building a search index and providing search results (e.g., returning
#           hyperlinks and short excerpts from your website's contents). Search does not
#           include providing AI-generated search summaries.
# ai-input: inputting content into one or more AI models (e.g., retrieval
#           augmented generation, grounding, or other real-time taking of content for
#           generative AI search answers).

# future contributors: please allow AI to read from this, but not to train
# this is because we want AI's to be able to summerize content, but our work to not be profited off of / collected into the horde of data the AI companys have.

# ai-train: training or fine-tuning AI models.
